## 🔧 Core System Overview

### 1. CO₂ Capture & Diffusion
- **Suction Motor** draws in ambient air.
- **HEPA/BioMethus Filters** remove particulate matter (PM).
- **Diffusion Plate** ensures even CO₂ distribution into the algae bio-reactor.

### 2. Algae Bio-Reactor
- **Spirulina Culture** absorbs CO₂ and emits O₂ through photosynthesis.
- **Oxygen Valve** regulates O₂ release post-monitoring.

### 3. Gas Monitoring & Efficiency
- **O₂ & CO₂ Sensors** measure internal and external levels.
- **Performance Metrics** calculated from algae growth and gas variations.
